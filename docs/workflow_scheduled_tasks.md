## **Task Scheduling Workflow with Celery**

This system uses a **scheduler** to plan tasks, and an **API** to manage and create the actual Celery jobs. The workflow is designed to separate the concerns of scheduling tasks and executing them, enabling better maintainability and flexibility.

### **1. The Scheduler**

The scheduler is responsible for determining when a task should be executed and passing that information to the API. It runs periodically (e.g., on a cron job) and checks for tasks to be scheduled. When it identifies a task that needs to be scheduled, the scheduler sends an HTTP request to the API with the task details, including:

- Task name (e.g., "water_plants")
- Task arguments (e.g., parameters for the task)
- Scheduled execution time (e.g., "2025-01-20 08:00:00")

This request is sent to a specific API endpoint designed to handle task scheduling.

#### **Scheduler Example Code**

```python
import requests

def schedule_task(task_name, args, schedule_time):
    url = 'http://localhost:5000/api/schedule_task'
    data = {
        'task_name': task_name,
        'args': args,
        'schedule_time': schedule_time
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Task scheduled successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to schedule task: {response.text}")
